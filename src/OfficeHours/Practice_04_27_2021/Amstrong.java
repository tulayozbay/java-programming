[Armstrong]

Create a method that will accept a number and determine if that number is an Armstrong number or not. Return a boolean.

A number is an Armstrong number if the single digits of the number raised to the power of the number of digits is equal to the original number

    Ex:
        153
    Each digit: 1 5 3
    is raised to the power of the number of digits
    153 has 3 digits so each single digit gets raised by 3:
    Calculation is: (1^3), (5^3), (3^3)
    Then the addition of each part is added:
    1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 => 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
    and so the total value of the calculation is 153 which is equal to the original number, which means 153 is an Armstrong number
